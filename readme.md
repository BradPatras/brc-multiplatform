üößÔ∏è &nbsp; Under Construction &nbsp; üöß

Bare-bones remote config library for Android and iOS.  Motivation for this project is having simple remote configs in my app projects where pulling in Firebase would be overkill.

<sup>Previously I had implemented this library separately for both Android and iOS using their respective languages, those repos still exist, here: [brc-android](https://github.com/bradpatras/brc-android), [brc-ios](https://github.com/bradpatras/brc-ios) but this library effectively replaces those.</sup>

## Config file format
Configs are in JSON format. Compatible data types include `integer`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, and `array(integer|string|boolean)`. Nested objects are not officially supported.

Example of config format
```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "someFlag": false,
  "someMessage": "Welcome to easy config!",
  "nullValue": null,
  "arrayOfWords": ["super", "duper", "simple", "configs"]
}
```
`v` is an integer value representing the config file's version. It's not required, but if it's present the client libraries will use this value when deciding if their local cache needs updating.

## In practice
This repo is hosting an [example config json file](/examples/simple.json). This example config is currently being consumed by the [Android](https://github.com/BradPatras/brc-android) and [iOS](https://github.com/BradPatras/brc-ios) demo apps. 

üîê &nbsp; Custom request headers can be passed into the initializer to facilitate auth tokens or whatever else.

### Initialization
```swift
// Swift
let brc = BasicRemoteConfigs(
  remoteUrl: "https://github.com/BradPatras/brc-multiplatform/raw/main/simple-config.json",
  customHeaders: .init()
)
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin
private val brc = BasicRemoteConfigs(
  remoteUrl = "https://github.com/BradPatras/brc-multiplatform/raw/main/simple-config.json"
)
```

----
### Fetching
```swift
// Swift
Task {
  do {
    try await brc.fetchConfigs(ignoreCache: false)
    text = brc.getKeys().joined(separator: "\n")
  } catch {
    text = error.localizedDescription
  }
}
```

```kotlin
// Kotlin
coroutineScope {
    try {
        brc.fetchConfigs()
        withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
            updateUI(brc.getKeys().joinToString(separator = ",\n"))
        }
    } catch (error: Throwable) {
        withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
            updateUI("Encountered an error when fetching configs")
        }
    }
}
```

## Future
I am patiently waiting for the day when direct [kotlin to swift export](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-64572/The-first-public-release-of-Swift-Export?_gl=1*fq78w3*_gcl_au*MTY3NTg0NDY3OS4xNzQ2NTc5NTQ0*FPAU*MTY3NTg0NDY3OS4xNzQ2NTc5NTQ0*_ga*MTQ5NTIyOTU0MS4xNzQ1OTgwOTIx*_ga_9J976DJZ68*czE3NDY4NDI4ODIkbzQkZzEkdDE3NDY4NDMwMTQkajU0JGwwJGgw) is released because the reliance on Objective-C is one of the biggest downsides of kmp in my opinion (coming from an iOS developer). Hopefully that'll improve the ergonomics on the iOS side a little bit. The roadman says they're aiming for a 2025 public release! ü§û
