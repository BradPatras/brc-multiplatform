![gradle build workflow](https://github.com/BradPatras/brc-multiplatform/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg)

The kotlin multiplatform implementation of the [Basic Remote Configs](https://github.com/BradPatras/basic-remote-configs) library. 

If this goes well, it will replace the platform-specific libraries, [brc-ios](https://github.com/BradPatras/brc-ios) and [brc-android](https://github.com/BradPatras/brc-android).

_one brc to rule them all_
